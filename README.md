# sign-language-classifier
In the context of Concordia's COMP-472, this project tackles communication barriers faced by the deaf community in public spaces, where limited sign language proficiency can cause exclusion. Building on neural translation research, it develops a classifier for faster, more natural interaction than written communication.
